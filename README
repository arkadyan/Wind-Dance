Wind Dance is a tool for taking the wind measurements from weather data and using them to generated diagrams describing dance steps.

Given a day's worth of weather data, the program takes a representative reading for each hour and uses that to to determine the size and direction of the barb it plots. These barbs are spaced according to wind speed and direction as well.

Wind Dance takes data in a comma-separated file, such as generated by Weather Underground (e.g., the bottom of http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBED/2011/02/05/DailyHistory.html).

Wind Dance is currently written in Ruby-Processing (https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing/wiki). I'm looking to convert it to a language and framework that can easily output vector-based images, quite possibly Flash.
